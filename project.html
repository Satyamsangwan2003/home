                <h1>Flora and Fauna</h1>
                <p>The term flora and fauna was coined by biologists to refer to a collection of plant and animal specifies in a given geographic location.</p>
               <p>Of all the living organisms on the planet, the most commonly seen by us are the plant life and the animal life. </p>
               <h2><b>Importance of Flora and Fauna</b></h2>
               <ul>
                   <li> Maintains ecological balance.</li>
                   <li> Expands local economies.</li>
                   <li>Aesthetic value.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>They are on the verge of extinction.We have about 20 species of plants and 410 species of animals, birds and fishes on the verge of extinction. Many factors are responsible for the depletion of flora and fauna — population explosion, hunting, forest fires, expansion of agriculture, extensive use of fossil fuels, destruction of natural habitats, climatic changes, pollution, natural disasters, deforestation and many more.</p>

                <h2>Endangered species</h2>
                <p>Endangered species, any species that is at risk of extinction because of a sudden rapid decrease in its population or a loss of its critical habitat.</p>
              <p>some of hazards occur naturally, most are caused by human beings and their economic and cultural activities. The most pervasive of these threats is habitat loss and degradation—that is, the large-scale conversion of land in previously undisturbed areas driven by the growing demand for commercial agriculture, logging, and infrastructure development.</p>
                <h1>Acts</h1>
                <h3 class="act1">IUCN Red List Of Threatened Species</h3>
                <p>One of the most well-known objective assessment systems for declining species is the approach unveiled by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 1994. It contains explicit criteria and categories to classify the conservation status of individual species on the basis of their probability of extinction. This classification is based on thorough, science-based species assessments </p>
                <h3 class="act1">The United States Endangered Species Act</h3>
                <p> The Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 obligates federal and state governments to protect all life threatened with extinction, and this process is aided by the creation and continued maintenance of an endangered species list, which contains 1,662 domestic and 686 foreign species of endangered or threatened animals and plants as of 2019.</p>
